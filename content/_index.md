I'm zetsu. Brazilian, 20 years old.

I had my first work experience as a Full-Stack Web Developer, acquiring practical knowledge on the development and maintenance of a production-grade application.

For over a year, most of my focus has been on learning how to find and exploit web vulnerabilities, having PortSwigger Web Security Academy and HackTheBox as my main sources of knowledge and practice. At the moment, I'm also learning Android application development and penetration testing.

This website is the place where I'll keep all the personal notes that I've found somehow relevant throughout my learning path and decided to make public, besides some blog posts that I might eventually write.

Here's where you can find me:
