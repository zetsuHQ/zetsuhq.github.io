These are my personal notes for most of the topics I've completed in the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/) platform.

The write-ups do not follow a standard format. Some of them are organized by labs, other are based on the content, while some of them might be a complete mess.

You might also notice that I sometimes have different lab IDs and session cookie values in screenshots for the same lab. This is because I often took a lot of time to complete them, and would usually be inactive on the page for a few minutes while searching for references, which led to the lab being reset.

For now, not all of the notes I have are published here. This is due to the fact that it takes some time to place each image in it's right place, besides checking the notes for typos and inaccuracies.
