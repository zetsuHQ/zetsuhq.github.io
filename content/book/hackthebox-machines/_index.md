[HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com) Machines are boot2root challenges where you start as an outsider and aim on going all the way to the most privileged user in a remote computer. These machines contain two flags, which are files located in the home directories of a regular user and the administrative user of the operating system. In order to finish the lab, one must gain access to and submit the contents of both the user and root flags in the platform.
