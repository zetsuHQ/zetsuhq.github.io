The following is a collection of writeups, personal notes and mini-essays. My goal on publishing this is not to become a reliable source of knowledge on any topic whatsoever, but to keep record of the way I think, allowing whoever might be interested on it, to read it. And mostly, to be a way of learning through one of the most effective ways: by teaching (in this case, myself).
