## Foothold/User

### Q1: What is the name of the HTML file that reveals the names of users working at the target company?

Starting with nmap, scanning all TCP ports right away, just to avoid having to run it twice, as I did in [Forest](../forest/).

```bash
$ nmap -sCV -p- --min-rate=1000 -oN nmap/complete.nmap 10.129.95.180
```
```
# Nmap 7.94SVN scan initiated Wed Jul 31 21:46:55 2024 as: nmap -sCV -p- --min-rate=1000 -oN nmap/complete.nmap 10.129.95.180

We see that there's an IIS HTTP server on Port 80. Let's take a look at it.

![alt text](image-1.png)

Clicking on "About Us" in the top navigation bar, we get redirected to `/about.html`. By scrolling down, we notice that it gives us names of some employees.

![alt text](image-2.png)

**R1: about.html**

### Q2: Which user has Kerberos Pre-Authentication disabled?

This question kinda indicates that we won't be able to use anonymous bind on LDAP to get the usernames, but we can use the information from the about page in order to build a list and attempt running `GetNPUsers` with it.

I used the following script to generate a list from those names:

https://github.com/captain-noob/username-wordlist-generator

Here's the resulting list:

```

Now, running the `GetNPUsers` script:

```bash
$ impacket-GetNPUsers egotistical-bank.local/ -outputfile npusers.txt -format hashcat -usersfile userlist.txt -dc-ip "10.129.95.180"
```
![alt text](image-3.png)


**R2: FSmith**

### Q3: What is the hash format returned from this AS-REP Roasting attack? Given the answer as the string between the first and third $ characters, including the $.

**R3: \$krb5asrep\$23\$**

### Q4: What is the password of the user fsmith?

Now we can attempt cracking that hash. I did it with hashcat.

```bash
$ hashcat -a 0 npusers.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
![alt text](image-4.png)

**R4: Thestrokes23**

### Q5: Now that you have a valid set of credentials, on what port can you connect to the machine and get an interactive shell?

As we saw on the nmap output, port `5985` is open, which is the default port for WinRM, we learned in Forest that it is a protocol for remote access on windows.

This way, we can connect to the machine using evil-winrm, which besides giving the shell, also contains other stuff that are useful to pwn Windows.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i "10.129.95.180" -u "fsmith" -p "Thestrokes23"
```

**R5: 5985**

## Privilege Escalation

### Q6: What user is configured to autologin?

Trying to get user information:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\FSmith\Documents> get-localuser
```
![alt text](image-6.png)


At this point, I spent a while searching for simple ways to get this user property, but none worked, so I read the lab's hint, which suggested to run [winPEAS](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS). I used specifically the PowerShell version.

After a couple of seconds watching the winPEAS output, I found this section:

![alt text](image-7.png)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winlogon

A friend of mine also said afterwards that you could also search for Winlogon credentials with the `reg` command:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\FSmith\Documents\ComplexConfigurationStuff> reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"
```
![alt text](image-8.png)

**R6: svc_loanmanager**

What confuses me about that question is the fact that `svc_loanmanager` is not the username that we use to get shell as the user. I only noticed that after spending a couple of minutes trying to figure out why I couldn't get shell and realizing that the user appeared as `SVC_LOANMGR` in BloodHound, which we could actually use to connect. 

### Q7: What is the password of the svc_loanmanager user?

**R7: Moneymakestheworldgoround!**

### Q8: Since you have a valid set of credentials for the svc_loanmanager user you can use WinRM once again and switch to that user. What is the dangerous right that this user has over the domain?

After logging in as this new user, we can use BloodHound to help us on finding vectors for further privilege escalation. Refer to [the official documentation](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/) on how to do that.

After marking both users as owned and executing the "Shortest Path to High Value Targets" query, we get this indicator that the `svc_loanmanager` user had the necessary privileges for DCSync over the domain.

![alt text](image-9.png)

What's odd here is that the guided mode didn't accept "DCSync" as a valid answer for the current question, so I just ignored it and continued the chain.

I then ran secretsdump to perform the DCSync attack and get the NTLM hashes from everyone.

```bash
$ secretsdump.py -just-dc 'svc_loanmgr:Moneymakestheworldgoround!@10.129.95.180' -outputfile "hashes"
```

Single quotes are needed so bash doesn't try to interpret the exclamation mark in the password as something else.

![alt text](image-10.png)

Getting shell as administrator with the NT hash:

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i "10.129.95.180" -u "Administrator" -H "823452073d75b9d1cf70ebdf86c7f98e"
```
![alt text](image-11.png)


After getting the root flag, I went to take a look at the write-up to find the answers for the questions I didn't get right.

In the Privilege Escalation section, in "BloodHound", I found this image:

![alt text](image-12.png)

I believe that this GetChangesAll and the DCSync rights are equivalent here. Probably the writer of the official write-up just used a different bloodhound version that didn't translate the GetChangesAll permission to DCSync.

**R8: GetChangesAll**

### Q9: You know that the user svc_loanmanager is able to perform a DCSync attack. By doing so, you will get the hash for the Administrator user. What is the common name of the attack that allows users to authenticate with their hashes instead of cleartext passwords?

This one I just guessed by the amount of characters, but the thing is that Pass the Hash is just a term for the action of using an NT hash for authentication without having knowledge of the actual password.

**R9: Pass the Hash**

That was the second machine of the Active Directory 101 track. It took me much less time to pwn, since it is very similar to Forest. The thing with getting the usernames from the about page and using them to attempt AS-REP roasting was cool. I had heard of this concept before and the machine was my first opportunity to put it in practice.
